potato hashing:

series of benchmarks

TLB measurement, using ‘perf’ 
workload and memory size?

1. how many threads? parallel workload? let's stay single thread, for now
2. some workload suggestion, omnet and stuffs
3. blow up the footprint by 25%, page table cycle size
4. hit rate and miss rate
5. TLB miss rates per million instructions
6. collect performance numbers, turn some flag off.
